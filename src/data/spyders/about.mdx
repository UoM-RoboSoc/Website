The Spyder Project focuses on the design and development of a hexapod robot, where participants join one of two teams to build a six-legged robot capable of being controlled remotely, along with any additional features they choose to implement. This project is designed to provide technical learning, ideal for those with prior experience in CAD, electronics, or programming. Participants will deepen their understanding of mechanical design, embedded systems, and robotics integration through practical, hands-on collaboration and problem-solving
Skills that they will learn:
- CAD
- 3D printing Iteration
- Embedded Systems
- Programming a raspberry Pi
