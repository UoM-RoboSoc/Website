The Robot Fighting League (R.F.L.) is a hands-on project where you’ll design, build, and battle your own 150 g antweight fighting robot. Guided step by step, you’ll use CAD to create custom parts, 3D print and assemble your design, and put it to the test in the workshop. Along the way, you’ll pick up practical skills in CAD, soldering, basic electronics, and general workshop techniques such as sawing, sanding, and drilling. Whether you’re mechanically minded or a complete beginner, this project is the perfect way to dive into engineering, creativity, and a bit of friendly robot combat!
