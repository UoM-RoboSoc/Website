This year, we’re aiming to create a competitive team for the RFL Beetleweight competitions! A team will be selected through an application process to represent us at a Bristol Bot Builders event, where they will compete with a 1.5 kg class robot.

To join, you’ll need to be an expert and can apply for one of the available team roles. Commitment is essential, you’ll be expected to help bring the bot fully ready to compete in February. If you love robot fighting and want to see some real action, submit your application and join the team! More details on the application process will be announced soon on our social media pages.
