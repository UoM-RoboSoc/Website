Now in its third successful year, ARTEMIS is our advanced, drone-based research and development project. The challenge for the upcoming year is to design a highly innovative modular robotic system: a drone that can autonomously fly, land, and dock with a wheeled ground unit, effectively transforming into a rover. The primary engineering focus will be on perfecting a magnetic docking system and running both the aerial and ground units from the drone's central processor.
