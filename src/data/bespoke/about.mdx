The society will fund and support a limited number of personal projects! If you have a burning passion to build something but don’t have access to a workshop, the Bespoke Project is for you. We can provide access to the university’s world-class facilities and cover or partially fund your costs. Ready to get started? Submit your application for a bespoke project through the form on our Linktree!
