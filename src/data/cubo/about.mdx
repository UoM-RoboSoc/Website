CUBO (Cube Utilising Brutal Over-engineering) is a hands-on project where teams will design and build autonomous robots capable of solving a Rubik's Cube in under 60 seconds. Members will work on circuit board design, computer vision, programming, and assembling mechanical parts. Step-by-step guidance and resources will be provided, but the project is aimed at members with some prior experience in electronics or programming who want a fun and challenging project.
