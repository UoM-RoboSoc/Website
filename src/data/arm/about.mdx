The primary objective of the ARM project for the 2025/26 academic year is to develop the complex software and vision systems required to create a fully autonomous poker-dealing robot. Building on last yearâ€™s progress, we will be utilizing the existing mechanical design of the robotic arm, a sustainable approach that allows us to focus almost entirely on the more challenging software and computer vision elements. This makes ARM an ideal project for members who want to specialize in robotics software, giving hands-on experience in computer vision, advanced programming logic, and precise servo and actuator control while tackling one of the most exciting challenges in autonomous robotics.
