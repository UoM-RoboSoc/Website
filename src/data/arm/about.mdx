Over the past 3 years, Robosoc has been building up a code base to allow our robotic arm to play chess against a human opponent. This codebase includes inverse kinematics, trajectory planning, basic AI and computer vision code. Now that we have completed the purpose of the arm, we are changing course to make this robotics arm play poker!
