The Buggy Project is an exciting, beginner-friendly initiative where teams will design and build an autonomous quad buggy capable of navigating a maze in a competition. Each team will receive a kit containing essential components, including an Arduino, motor driver, chassis, motors, sensors, and other necessary parts. Along with comprehensive guides and support materials to assist throughout the project.

What you have to do:

    - Build buggy - use your creativity and instructions

    - Programme the Arduino - tell it how to sense the world! Get it ready for the challenges

    - Test - tweak your components and run your programme!

    - Turn up!

The competition:

    - Race

    - Wall stop - who can stop closest

    - Maze - travel through without hitting the wall (watch video below)
